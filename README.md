## Features

- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualize data trends using bar and line charts.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter data by date range, age, and gender for tailored insights.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access with user authentication and session management.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes for seamless user experience.
- **Real-time Updates**: Fetch data dynamically to ensure the latest information is displayed.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Redux Toolkit, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Charting Library**: Chart.js
- **Data Integration**: Google Sheets API for ETL
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## ETL Process

This project uses an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process to fetch and store data from a Google Sheet, allowing up-to-date information for analytics. The process involves:

1. **Extract**: Accessing data from a Google Sheet using Googleâ€™s Sheets API and Service Account for authentication. Credentials are securely stored in environment variables.
2. **Transform**: Cleaning and formatting the extracted data for consistency and usability, transforming fields such as "Day," "Age," and "Gender" into usable formats.
3. **Load**: Saving the transformed data into a MongoDB database for efficient access, where it is continuously updated by clearing old entries and inserting new data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-visualization-dashboard.git
   cd data-visualization-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd client
   npm install

   # Backend
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in `.env` for the `server`:
   - MongoDB URI
   - Google Sheets API credentials (`client_email` and `private_key`)

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start the backend server
   cd server
   npm start

   # Start the frontend server
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the dashboard.
- Use the filters to customize your data view.
- Click on any feature in the bar chart to display its timeline in the line chart below.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
